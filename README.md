# Scrimba Unit Converter

This project is a unit converter built as part of the [Scrimba's Learn JavaScript course](https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v).
It allows users to convert between MEtric and Imperial units for length, volume and mass.

The password generator allows users to create strong, random passwords of variable length. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- **Conversion**: Easily convert by clicking the "convert" button. All conversions are rounded down to 3 decimal places.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the user input is valid (a number) and within the range of 0 to 10,000,000. Displays a warning message in a readable red color if the input exceeds the allowed limit.
- **Dark and Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light modes. Implementing this toggle was the most challenging part of the project for me, as it was my first time integrating a dark mode feature. But by searching on the web I was able to find a solution that worked for me.
